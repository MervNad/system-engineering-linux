#Lesson 5: Visual commit

Commit with default text editor
Sometimes we are using editors to add commit messages. Let us check how it looks and we can change the default editor.

##1. Use editor to commit files

Text editor for create message for commit

until now, we have been using -m to add commit messages. let us try something different. Imagine we are working in our repo and we have some files in stage. let us commit one of them.

$git commit testfile-01

the default editor appears, which is nano. We can use it to add a commit messsage ot exit.

Default editor

Let us check if we have anything configured
$git config --global --list | grep editor

If we did not configure the gloabl editor, no output will will come on our terminal.
we could also check for the system or the local too. (local means specific to the current repo; system means for the whole system).
the previous command, we ask git to show us the whole confguration in global space and we grep  the outout to find the information about editor only.

Let us change it to our chosen editor(preferred).
$git config --global core.editor vi

Let us check our config again
$git config --global --list | grep editor

now the commit message will be using vim and not nano.
